## 🧠 Abstract  

**FlexRok** is a modular, autonomous ground rover engineered for exploration in environments inaccessible or hazardous to humans.  
It features a **6-wheeled rocker-bogie suspension system** enhanced with a **spring-based secondary suspension**, improving terrain adaptability and vibration damping.  

Powered by **Raspberry Pi 4** and **Arduino Uno**, the rover executes:  

- Vision-based object and obstacle detection  
- Autonomous navigation within bounded zones  
- Servo-actuated steering and camera control  
- Pick-and-place operations via a robotic arm  

This integration of **mechanical**, **electrical**, and **computer vision** systems offers a cost-effective and scalable solution for autonomous field robotics.
